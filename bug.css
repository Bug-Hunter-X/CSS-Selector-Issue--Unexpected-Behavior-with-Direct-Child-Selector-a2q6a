The CSS code has an unusual error in its selector. The selector `#myElement > p` is used to select only `<p>` elements that are direct children of the element with the ID `myElement`. However, if there is an intermediate element between `#myElement` and the `<p>` element, the `<p>` element will not be selected. This can lead to unexpected styling issues if the developer assumes that the `<p>` elements will be selected regardless of their parent hierarchy.
